                  I hate this word Sh*tcoin, we need to come up with something
                  else that's more clean. Today I want to talk about what makes
                  a sh*tcoin and how you can spot such a potential coin. I will
                  talking about alot of people's favorite alt-coins such as ETH,
                  if this will offend you I suggest leaving now. I am mainly
                  interested in Bitcoin (BTC) however I do hold other actual
                  decentralized altcoins but some may consider my opinions similar
                  to those of a maxi (Bitcoin Maximalist). I would like to add
                  that I have been in and out of the crypto space since 2013 and
                  have seen alot over the years, I originally joined the space
                  because of the idea to replace the government money so I could
                  be slightly biased towards BTC.

                  Proof of Stake<a id="pos"></a>
                </h3>
                
                <p>
                Now depending where you get your information from you may have
                heard Proof of Stake (PoS) is the savior of crypto saving making it
                upwards of 99% more efficient, these claims are true but they
                fail to mention what you are giving up as it comes at a massive
                cost. First of all you have now come full circle and removed the
                need for a cryptocurrency in the first place. Why is this? Simple,
                who runs the nodes? Those with the most stake ie. the rich. So
                now the rich control the blockchain and can sensor transactions
                and you and I already know many rich people have alot of contacts
                so they will collude together very easily to make these changes.
                Secondly the current system is designed around staking, like I
                just mentioned you have removed the need for a cryptocurrency.
                What do I mean by this? PoS basically works like a printer your
                creating money (coins) out of thin air like the current system.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                If you don't understand Proof of Work (PoW) I will gloss over it
                here. PoW has 2 systems to it the nodes and the miners, the role
                for these changes depending on the blockchain meaning Ethereum
                (ETH) PoW is not the same as BTC PoW (I will touch on this lightly).
                When you create a transaction it is sent to the nodes a miner then
                collects all transactions in a block and sends it back to the
                nodes to validate if majority of nodes agree the block is pushed
                on chain. The difference with say ETH PoW is that the nodes all
                are forced to run on whatever version ETH Foundation says where
                in Bitcoin the version or new features that people want added must
                be approved by the majority of nodes to work.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                With this understanding the biggest difference with PoS removes
                the miner from the equation. In PoW the miner is rewarded for
                solving the block and anyone can solve the block there are people
                with 5$ USB miners who solve a block, now yes extremely unlikely.
                Most miners join what's called a pool and when the pool solves
                blocks together they are all rewarded where solo mining you are
                paid 0 until you yourself solve a block. In PoS since you have no
                miner the nodes are given the reward for solving the block, well
                the issue here is that you need a certain amount of stake to run
                a node unlike other PoW coins which anyone can run a node. At the
                time of writing it costs 32 ETH to run a validator node that's
                around 50K USD, and you can't even withdraw the money either like
                at all the function doesn't exist yet. How stupid does that sound!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                So you need to be to be rich to run a node on PoS but why does it
                matter? Well those who build and verify the blocks are the ones
                who can block transactions. For a transaction to be blocked on
                BTC the nodes and miners would have to agree, if your miner says
                person X isn't allowed transactions don't include him but 51% of
                nodes say no then that block isn't counted. Your wasting money
                and energy mining for nothing literally... So what if they owned
                51% of nodes and they did agree person X should be banned from
                making transactions. Well at this point the network automatically
                does what's called a hard fork and becomes 2 seperate chains. An
                example of this is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) that forked off BTC in 2017.
                Then it's up to the people to decide which is the preffered version
                to use, so if people disagree collectively from banning anyone
                then mainchain BTC would have them banned cause 51% of the nodes
                say so but everyone else would move to say Bitcoin X where that
                didn't happen and remove all value from BTC, again making this
                a huge waste of time and money because even if they attack the
                new Bitcoin X it will just for to Bitcoin Y and happen again. I
                know this all sounds complex try to stay with me.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) chains like Cardano (ADA) are
                even worse than regular PoS chains. Yes I know ADA claims to be
                PoS not DPoS, it is not PoS because you are allowed to delegate
                coins to a node. It's that simple you are more then welcome to
                disagree with definitions. DPoS allows the rich to run nodes and
                then you stake or delegate our coins to the nodes which gives
                them more power to solve blocks faster as they have a higher
                chance to solve said blocks. Some chains like ADA limit how many
                coins can be staked per node to prevent this so the rich just 
                create multiple nodes for example as you can see in the link 
                below. Binance owns 62 nodes with 10.44% of total stake at the 
                time of writing.

                <p>
                Why is this worse though? Since everyone is now making money for
                staking like passive income, well not only are you still printing
                money doing 0 work your centralizing the network faster by giving
                the rich easier access to coins without needing to buy 51%. The
                other big reason is that since they control more of the stake
                they will keep growing faster than you forever like the current
                system. Say they stake 10 coins and make a reward of 10 coins per
                block and they pay out say 10% (even more than your average stock
                market gain YoY). Let's then say you stake 1 coin now that 10%
                is divided amongst all stakers lets say for simplicity there's
                100 each at 1 coin (because if they stake 2 coins they will get
                more of that 10% than you will) so you now make 0.1% of that 10
                coin reward per block and again for simplicity sake so did
                everyone else even though in reality that's not going to be the
                case. That node operator however made 9 coins and has 19 coins
                now where you have 1.1 coins. So you went from owning 10% of the
                node owners balance to 5.7% in just 1 block. The 1% love this
                method because it keeps them ontop forever...
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Another big issue with regular PoS is it slowly becomes DPoS over
                time because everyone wants to make "passive income" right? ETH
                quickly got a new "Decentralized Application" (DApp) called Lido
                which basically you give them your ETH and they stake the ETH in
                their pool and in return give u a new sh*tcoin instead called
                stETH, brilliant! -_- So this will long term cause everyone who
                can't afford 32 ETH to jump to platforms like this and similar
                platforms giving up stake to big "Decentralized Autonomous 
                Organizations" (DAOs) that are flawed (maybe I will write a post
                on this some time), however are the same as a foundation and are
                run by a select few people giving them control of these nodes. I
                mean someone has to stake the real ETH and run the node so again
                back to trusting others which Bitcoin was designed to remove. But
                I know I'm just some crazy BTC Maxi right?

                As we can see from the current distribution at least at the time
                of writing is total stake of 23.58% of all staked ETH is owned
                by Lido, amazing how that works isn't it? Followed up by none
                other than our favorite centralized exchanges. I don't care if
                you work for Lido and you want to say something stupid like it's
                decentralized because multiple different people are running nodes
                or some crap, the bottom line is people have to trust you to not
                screw them over first of all as you can run with the ETH literally
                as your giving them a fake stETH coin and second your gaining
                huge market control of the network.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                With PoS the person who owns the coins never has to sell either
                they will forever own their stake since they own the coins, in
                PoW hardware is constantly being improved every single year so
                you need to upgrade your hardware constantly to continue to own
                your percentage of hashrate. Hashrate is like the speed of which
                you mine blocks, so if you mine 1EH/s and a new miner comes out
                that mines faster at say 2EH/s your total percentage of speed
                will be slower out of everyone elses. This means to attack the
                network you not only need to hardware once you would also need
                to keep buying new hardware to maintain control (think government),
                this is why people who want control don't use PoW.

                <p>
                Wow... I mean really guys, we got a diehard community for Proof
                of Authority (PoA) coins? So much so that even the largest crypto
                channel on Youtube says he loves it... are people just insane?
                Do they not understand the point the blockchain was made for?
                For those saying right now who am I to decide what the blockchain
                is to be used for I get it, I have no say I agree but let me ask
                you this why should I use a blockchain that's expensive and slow
                to run compared to something like a simple database? I mean if
                I'm going to centralize the blockchain what's the point of it?
                That's right money... I must have forgot -_-
                </p>

                So for those that don't know unlike other centralized chains that
                try to hide themselves as being centralized PoA chains are open
                about it. THey control the network and transactions CBDCs are a
                good example of PoA type of chains. There are others however in
                the space that are PoA such a VeChain, Cronos and BNB. Ripple in
                a way is also like a PoA because the validators have to allow your 
                validator to be allowed to verify blocks. VeChain even has patents,
                like that just proves even more they are an unregistered security
                acting as crypto to make themselves more money but I digress.

                <p>
                The point is these are the worst form of consensus and are 100%
                not decentralized in any way, these will probably be used along
                CBDCs to make smart contract platform or something similar to
                DApps with CBDCs to make everything fully controlled. If your
                "invested" in one of these don't worry we already know you have
                no idea what your buying no need to tell us to buy your sh*tcoin.

                <p>
                Everyone's favorite controversial topic Initial Coin Offering
                (ICO), and Initial Public Offering (IPO). IPOs are used by real
                companies to sell registered securities to people. In the crypto
                space however we call these "Premines" and basically it means
                instead of starting the blockchain at 0 coins and each block
                reward generates new coins you start at whatever value you want
                and sell them off for profit before the network even starts the
                first block (and usually give yourself a bunch of coins). The
                real issue here is you have made your blockchain for 1 reason to
                make money, your not looking to actually solve a problem your
                looking to profit and not only that but you want to ensure your
                profit by selling coins before even launching incase something

                People argue ICOs are just the way things are these days or that
                premines are needed so foundations have enough coins to sell over
                time to fund development. If you need to keep a bunch of coins to
                sell overtime I'm sorry but your project sucks... Many coins have
                launched without ICOs and are successful I will get into at the
                end. I would argue over 90% of coins have launched with an ICO
                making pretty much everything a sh*tcoin. Messari can show you
                the ICO if existing for each coin you just have to look them up.
                Sadly they want people to not know the ICO numbers and have
                decided to support these scams by hiding these under a paid
                subscription. I have provided an image below from Messari comparing
                different ICOs all of them are bad they should all start at 0.

                I do want to make one understanding to ICOs however, and that is
                that it's very difficult these days to launch a project at 0 coins
                without some serious hype around it as miners could easily 51%
                attack the network in PoW and in the case of PoS It's not even
                possible to launch without an ICO as without someone owning coins
                nodes can't verify blocks. The issue is that ICO has been the
                bandaid solution which is stupid in my opinion instead we should
                be looking into ways to either improve PoW or better yet make a
                new better decentralized protocol (and no PoS isn't it). Something
                that doesn't need an ICO to launch and is as decentralized or
                even more decentralized than PoW. This should be our focus but
                instead it's about who can make the most money launching a shiny
                new coin that's why all ICOs are sh*tcoins. Yes even if they are
                doing something unique because the foundation is flawed. Would
                you buy a house if the foundation was broken or rotting away?

                <p>
                This should be super obvious but it's not, in fact it's the
                opposite people get excited by roadmaps as a sign of the price
                going up when something new launches on the coin. If your project
                or coin has a roadmap it means it's centralized/controlled by it's
                foundation as they are 100% able to control the changes to the
                network, this makes it a sh*tcoin because it to is no different
                than the current centralized system of using a database. You
                might be thinking well Bitcoin is run by Bitcoin Core so it to
                is centralized as all updates are pushed by them, in which you
                are incorrect. Bitcoin Core is indeed the main node however they
                have multiple versions available at a time for nodes to upgrade
                to and if 51% of nodes don't upgrade that change isn't made and
                it is reverted after 6-7 months (The time they like to launch a
                major release). Consensus is usually accepted after some time
                however if Bitcoin Core disagrees with your changes you are more
                than welcome to fork the current code base and make your changes
                run it on your node and convince others if 51% move to your
                version Bitcoin Core would have to adopt the change before making
                the next release. Good luck convincing other nodes though it would
                need to be a pretty major change for the better as otherwise there
                isn't much need to upgrade what isn't broken. Any new Bitcoin 
                Improvement Protocol (BIP) must be approved by 95% to be successful.
                You can learn more about Bitcoin Core at the link below if your
                interested.

                Again this should be obvious if your trademarking the name it's
                more like a brand than an open decentralized project that anyone
                can change. The biggest case of this was actually with ETH back
                in 2016 called the DAO hack you can look it up if your more
                interested. Basically what happened was ETH launched with it's
                premine and 3 months later it was hacked in which the hacker
                stole 60 of the 150 million of ICO funds. Ethereum claimed at
                it's launch that "code is law" however that wasn't the case here
                they decided they want to hard fork the current codebase with a
                patch to fix that bug and return all the original investors funds.
                However others in the community who agreed with the original code
                is law motto didn't like that idea despite being upset they lost
                their own money. Ethereum since it would need to hard fork from
                the main chain decided to instead trademark the name so the
                original chain couldn't be called Ethereum and instead had to be
                renamed to Ethereum Classic for legal reasons. Quite ridiculous
                and a clear sign it's a security if you ask me. Many other projects
                have since filed for trademarks on the name of their project
                just proving they are the same sh*tcoins.

                <p>
                My biggest gripe with alot of projects is the foundations themselves.
                The problem is the premine and the control they have over the
                project. They are basically like the CEOs or The Board of the
                project and have 100% control. If a project has a foundation it
                doesn't 100% make it a sh*tcoin but it's something to look into
                for sure and see how they opperate so I thought I would mention
                it.

                  Smart Contracts<a id="foundations"></a>
                </h3>
                
                <p>
                Lastly I want to touch base with Smart Contracts these are your
                coins/projects than run ontop of other coins like ETH or ADA.
                These coins do not have any consensus what so ever so if your
                thinking well I don't like ETH but I like this DApp on ETH I
                will buy that instead the foundation it's standing on is flawed
                it relies on ETH for it to work. Some DApps have there own nodes
                and what not to store things but these are not consensus models.
                These coins tend to be the most centralized in my opinion, the
                coin or in this case the token is on the network itself but that's
                about it the functions of the actual token are happening elsewhere.
                For an example here is a link to The Graph (GRT) which you can
                see implements a minting system to nodes and what not but there
                are no functions in the contract for indexing or storing all the
                information they are providing as a service. In other words most
                of these tokens are just shares of a centralized service. I am
                not 100% against smart contracts I find things like GRT and
                Chainlink (LINK) very interesting but they are running on ETH and
                not their own decentralized blockchains so I am not interested.

                The conclusion is not that sh*tcoins won't make money but more
                to help educate people that most of coins following any one of
                these points has most likely or is profiting off you by you
                "investing" in them. The biggest take away should be that you
                are looking to buy something that doesn't resemble something that
                sounds like a company. Me personally I own BTC, LTC and XMR for
                the time being but there are more decentralized projects then these
                like DASH (other sketchy stuff happened at launch do research),
                Ravencoin (RVN), PIVX, Vertcoin (VTC), and even Dogecoin (DOGE).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Yes the list is very small and probably most are not very innovative
                over BTC hence why many BTC Maxis call everything sh*tcoins...
                What we need to see is a development focus on true decentralization
                either with new coins that are actually decentralized which is
                hard as I mentioned above because launching a new PoW network
                can get 51% attacked very easily. The better option is to just
                build ontop of Bitcoin like the Lightning Network. The other
                question is does your solution/problem require a blockchain in
                the first place or is it just a trendy thing to do to make some
                more money? Blockchains are slow and costly you are better off
                using a database for things like video games for example. I hope
                this post helps you research more into these hyped up projects
                just because they do something other than fixing the money system
                and decide for yourself if they are worth "investing" in. The
                SEC keeps pushing for crypto regulations sadly this needs to
                happen just like Martin Act of 1921 banning bucket shops and 
                eventually The Securities Act of 1933. People clearly don't do
                enough research into what they are buying and will buy anything
                as long as it promises the price to go up, so these regulations
                are sadly needed to protect the consumer gullible to these
                sh*tcoins. I didn't even cover the countless rugpulls where coins
                can either be bought without a spend function programmed into
                them or building hype around a project and dumping all their
                premined coins on the market so only they profit as they also
                own the code to develop the project (so no new updates will come).

                  Before I go I want to show you all Nostr social media built to
                  be decentralized without a blockchain! This is how most smart
                  contracts should be in my opinion. That's the reason I started
                  programming my own smart contracts to make sure it was possible
                  to make projects without needing a coin at all and yes it is,
                  however sadly 99% of projects or at least the ones we hear about
                  use tokens as a way for themselves to make profit not because
                  the token actually does anything, in other words it's acting
                  like a share to that project (ie. an unregistered security).
