              This guide covers how to use C-Lightning (CLN) it is based on the
              C Language (mainly) making it super lightweight.
            </p>

            <h3 class="header">Why?<a id="why"></a></h3>

            <p>
              Running a Lightning Node helps the Bitcoin Lightning network only
              and does not help mainnet. If you are interested running a
              lightning node you will need more computing power and more ram to
              be able to open more channels at one time. You will also require a
              good amount of BTC to actually have your channels be used, I would
              personally recommend over 0.5BTC that you are willing to hold on
              this node. HOLDING BTC ON THIS NODE IS NOT THE SAME AS COLD
              STORAGE, YOU CAN LOSE YOUR BTC IF YOUR NODE UPTIME IS BAD!
            </p>

            <p>
              You will want to backup your new private keys that's stored on the
              node elsewhere to have a backup just in case. I've read reports
              online of some people having their nodes offline for days at a
              time even without losing funds because the other parties didn't
              close channels or have any transactions stuck in motion. I would
              still be cautious of this however and don't look at it as an easy
              way to make some extra sats with no risk.
            </p>

            <p>
              You also need to be able to connect to ideally your own bitcoin
              node, this can be run on the same machine however I would
              recommend run it on 2 different machines incase something were to
              happen. This guide covers how to connect to another machine on
              your local network using the local ip, so nothing is available
              from the outside.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lastly for the last why question, is that you make money, or I
              should say you can make money depending how much you want to
              charge for routing the transactions. If you just want to help the
              network you can process transactions at break even or even at
              negative amounts if you want to pay out of pocket for some reason.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since there is no lightning server package at the time of writing
              we will need to manually compile the code to build on OpenBSD. You
              will need to run the following command to install all the compile
              dependencies.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hardware wise CLN recommends 4GB of Ram and 5GB of storage if you
              are running a separate system for your Bitcoin Node.
            </p>

            <p>
              You will need a Bitcoin Node and I would recommend reading my
              older guide on this and running this on a separate computer.
            </p>

            <p>
              For Hobbyists CLN recommends against devices like Raspberry Pi's
              due to lower performance and not having a power backup like
              laptops. They recommend the average consumer use an older laptop,
              I would recommend something like Intel Core 7th gen or newer even
              U series CPUs will be fine if you plan to go this route. I would
              also say that a Raspberry Pi is fine and you can buy a cheaper
              100-200$ UPS (Power Backup) that will run it fine. I personally am
              using a Dell Optiplex 3050 with an i5 8500T, 32GB of very basic
              2666MHz DDR4, and a 2TB Samsung 870 EVO SSD connected to a basic
              600VA UPS.
            </p>

            >

            <p>
              For Power Users or those looking for something super reliable to
              most likely make some profit back off of, CLN recommends jumping
              up to ECC memory which will require usually server grade
              components (Xeon, EPYCs, Opterons) however there are these days
              some consumer boards that will take ECC memory so you could look
              around for those as well. This is a good recommendation as it will
              hopefully prevent most memory crashes.
            </p>

            >

            <p>
              CLN then recommends using an SSD over a HDD which I think if your
              at this spending level is an obvious choice I have been running
              only SSDs full time in my systems since 2017 and have never looked
              back to consider HDDs so I would agree with this recommendation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thirdly they recommend using some level of drive mirroring like
              RAID, this is another great option I have considered doing for my
              personal node as well, even RAID 1 will let you have a complete
              backup on a second drive. I've had issues setting up OpenBSD with
              RAID 1 in the past, mainly the bootloader install section, however
              I will include instructions for how to do this in the link below.
            </p>

            >

            <p>
              You will most likely want the disks to have a GPT Partition Style
              following those steps and you will need 2 similar sized drives.
              After that you can follow this guide.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lastly CLN recommends using a checksumming filesystem like BTRFS
              (Linux) or ZFS (Linux and FreeBSD). OpenBSD doesn't support either
              of these because of licensing issues and complexity to maintain
              and only supports UFS2 (FFS), if you are interested in a
              checksumming filesystem I would recommend ZFS on FreeBSD over
              BTRFS. I have used BTRFS on Linux for a few years with some minor
              issues, I haven't personlly used ZFS long enough to have issues
              with it (1 month) but it has been around 8 years longer so can be
              more refined. I would have to do a full deep dive into the 2 to
              really compare them but I trust a FreeBSD system more for uptime
              than Linux systems (speaking from over 5+ of experience on
              different distros as daily drivers).
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm not going to cover every little detail for how to install
              OpenBSD, it should be pretty straight forward like any other OS.
              Download the ISO/IMG file from the OpenBSD website (listed below)
              and burn it to a USB/Disc with the program of your choice then
              boot it (usually selecting it in the BIOS but ARM can differ).
              Most likely you will want to use the amd64 image unless you know
              you are using and arm/riscv SOC.
            </p>

            <p>
              The only real options you want to actually change are going to be
              sshd and xenodm. sshd will allow you to remote into the pc over
              the ssh protocol and will need to be hardened and adds a layer of
              potential access point for attackers (obviously). The other option
              xenodm is basically your Xorg (X11) server on OpenBSD, Bitcoin
              doesn't need a GUI to work so we can set this to 'no' and do
              everything in the terminal. Feel free to enable xenodm (it runs
              FVWM by default) you may want to install a better DE/WM (Desktop
              Environment/Window Manager) if you go that route.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you get to the stage about the drive you are going to want to
              most likely use GPT and then once it shows you all the partitions
              you will need to press 'e' and then enter to edit the paritions
              and you can then type 'p g' to print the partitions again but in
              GB (not bytes). OpenBSD for some reason doesnt fill the whole
              drive by default. From here you should see near the top free space
              in GB or G we need to add this free space to our /home directory
              usually partition L. We can do this by entering 'R l' and then
              enter, followed by doing '+60G' and then replace the 60 with your
              free GB. You can double check everything is ok by running 'p g'
              again to see the /home partition has grown in space. After this is
              confirmed press 'w' and then enter to write to the disk and then
              'q' and enter to quit and continue the install.
            </p>

            <p>
              I just named my user a basic name like lightning and did all the
              other default settings in my OpenBSD install. After you reboot
              into your installed OpenBSD system you will need to login as root
              and configure doas which is basically like OpenBSD's version of
              sudo.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>vi /etc/doas.conf</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Yes I know you probably want to use vim we will install it in a
              second. You will need to press 'i' to enable insert mode and type
              exactly the text below.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">

            <p>
              vi unlike vim it a little different to delete a typo you need to
              move the cursor back to the letter and type a new one or start
              over by pressing escape and ':q'. Once you have the text proper
              you can save and close vi by pressing escape and running ':wq'.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now we can exit the root user simply by running the command
              'exit'. Next we can login to the user we created and start
              installing packages.
            </p>

              To build the program you can find the link below on the offical
              git page with instructions specific to OpenBSD.
            </p>

            <p>
              After that we get into how to actually use the node. To launch the
              node is as simple as running ./lightningd where you have the
              executable compiled. For me it was inside the lightning directory
              I had downloaded and in a folder called lightningd so from the
              home directory launching it would look like
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote" cite="">
              <p>./lightning/lightningd/lightningd</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              From here lightning is now running in the background. Now we just
              need to configure some things. You can kill lightningd after maybe
              a minute or two by running
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote" cite="">
              <p>pkill lightningd</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              You may or may not need to use doas in front of that command. The
              reason you want to wait a minute or two is so that it has time to
              configure everything and make the directory we need. That
              directory is .lightning in your home directory. To make a config
              file run
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote" cite="">
              <p>vim .lightning/config</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Most of my guides use nano because it's easy for beginners to use,
              where vi and vim you need to learn a little to use. I did use vim
              in my Bitcoin Node guide however. Feel free to replace vi with vim
              or nano if you wish just make sure to add the package using
              pkg_add first. vi is stock in OpenBSD and functions similarly to
              vim.
            </p>

            <p>
              From here we want to add a few basic options like connecting our
              lightning node to our dedicated bitcoin node, you can also in
              theory connect it to a public facing RPC node. However considering
              this node holds real value as collateral I would strongly
              recommend self hosting your own Bitcoin node instead. We can
              enable encryption to protect the accounts from being accessed if
              for whatever reason the filesystem gets corrupted with an
              attacker. Everything else will just be how we want our node to
              function. Unlike the Bitcoin guide I will explain the options here
              because it's not as well documented. Below is the config file.

            <p>
              Alright let's break this down. The <b>rpc</b> stuff should be
              pretty straight forward, these all options you should have set in
              your Bitcoin config. You can check my OpenBSD Bitcoin guide if you
              need help with that as those settings apply regardless of
              Operating System you are using (file location may differ though).
              If you are running your Bitcoin node on the same machine as your
              lightning node you don't need any rpc options.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>encrypted-hsm</b> is the option to encrypt the node behind a
              password, this is optional but strongly recommended.
              <b>bind-addr</b> is binding the node to run on the machines local
              IP at the default port 9735, it's highly unlikely you want to
              change this. <b>alias</b> is what your name will be publically
              called, also optional it defaults to a random codename based on
              your public key you should set this to something so people
              recognize you and are more willing to open channels with you.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now we get into the more fine tuned options you most likely want
              to mess around with based on your goals. <b>fee-base</b> This is
              the base amount to charge any user per transaction that goes
              through your node. This is set in millisatoshis (a unit specfic to
              Lightning) with is 1/1,000th of a satoshi, 500 is half a sat and
              the default is 1000. This value varies from person to person from
              usually 0 to 5. It should also be noted If you change this option
              later it won't automatically update your current open channels and
              you will have to pay a network fee to update each one. If you have
              the collateral to have lots of channels you may be able to get
              away with a higher amount due to it costing less to go through
              your node vs 4x 500 fee nodes, otherwise you probably want this
              500 or less.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>fee-per-satoshi</b> This is the fee that is charged ontop of
              the base fee for every satoshi that passes through your node. This
              number is written in 1/1,000,000th of 100% so 10,000 is 1%, 10 or
              0.0001% is the default. This setting like the previous is only
              applied to new channels and needs to be changed for a fee on all
              existing channels. If your a smaller node you probably want a
              lower number here as well. This number is noted on sites like
              amboss as ppm or Price Per Million sats that pass through, the
              average ranges from 499 to 1499 but some nodes go outside of this
              range of course. You can calculate your ppm before opening any
              channels with some basic math at 500 its 0.05% 1,000,000 x 0.005 =
              500 remember 0.01 is 1% and 1 is 100 when calculating. This gives
              a rate of 500 ppm.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>min-capacity-sat</b> This is the lowest channel size you are
              willing to open with someone else. I set this to 10 sats which is
              super low and will probably never see any traffic if actually
              opened (it would infact cost more to open a 10 sat channel than
              the value of inside it...). I set this at 100,000, I would
              recommend changing this value the default is 10,000. I wouldn't
              recommend any channels smaller than 100,000 personally and some
              nodes require 1,000,000 sats or more to open a channel. The
              recommended channel size in the community is 1 to 5 million sats
              (0.01 to 0.05 BTC), if you can afford larger channels by all means
              do it but larger channels isn't everything as you won't be routing
              much payments if you don't have channels connecting to users.

              This is all you should really need to setup a basic node, however
              I encourage you to read the full documentation linked below if you

              You can now load up your lightning node. Assuming you cloned the
              repo into your home directory running it is as easy as
              ./lightning/lightningd/lightningd if you enable encrypted-hsm you
              will now be prompted for a password and your node should then be
              online. It will take some time to show up (up to a few hours in
              some cases), now we can use the cli while this is running to
              create some channels and fund the node.

            <p>
              If you are unfamiliar with TTYs they are like having a second
              terminal open without closing the first one (when you don't have a
              GUI). You can change TTYs by pressing CTRL + ALT + F# with # being
              any number. OpenBSD defaults Xorg (xenodm) to TTY5 for example
              which we aren't using here but if you were using it you would see
              it there. Linux varies from distro to distro but the command is
              often the same. You are most likely using TTY1 so we can just
              switch to TTY2 while leaving lightningd running in TTY1 by
              pressing CTRL + ALT + F2 you can check you are using TTY1 if you
              want by pressing CTRL + ALT + F1 after that and you should end up
              back to the terminal you just had open. But again make sure your
              using TTY2 from here on. In TTY2 just log in to your user again
              and this time we are going to run.

              You should get a response with a bunch of info about your node, if
              not double check lightningd is running in TTY1. This could also be
              not working because you changed your bind-addr in the config and
              it's not running on the localhost IP. After we know our node is
              running we can create a Bitcoin address to send money to add funds
              to our node.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">

            <p>
              This command will pull up one of the 22 receiving addresses based
              on your private key (most likely a different address each time you
              run it but it's to the same wallet). The currently default is a
              bech32 or native segwit address. You also have it output a Taproot
              address if your wallet supports sending via taproot to saves some
              gas fees. To use a taproot address add a space after newaddr and
              add p2tr and then run the command.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then using your Bitcoin wallet you can send a transaction to the
              address it has given you. If your new to this send a small amount
              first and then maybe send 0.01 BTC to open your first decent sized
              channel. You will need extra BTC in this wallet as well to cover
              gas fees as each channel opened is processed on Bitcoins mainnet.
              You can check the balance on the node by running
            </p>

            <p>
              This will show you all the funds across channels and public
              addresses in your wallet. I would recommend at this point looking
              at setting up TOR if that's what your interested in before adding
              any channels which I have listed how to do so below. If your not
              interested in TOR that's fine it's not needed. Now let's open our
              first channel. First we need to find a Node that is A) willing to
              open channels and B) has enough collateral to open a channel with
              you. To do this we can head over to amboss I will leave a link
              below and scroll down the page to the popular nodes section.
              Ignore 1ML we will talk about this one later for example Kraken
              (the exchange) is up there so I will use that example. If you
              click on their page it shows Min. "Channel Size" at the time of
              writting is 1,000,000 sats for Kraken. Kraken is likely to have
              collateral in their wallet to open up a channel with you, when you
              open up a channel in this case 1 million sats both parties put up
              1 million sats so the channel can function both ways. In some
              cases you may open a channel and you will see on amboss the
              channel isn't mutal (disabled). You will see an 2 arrows facing up
              or down showing the which channel is down. The up arrows mean the
              Node your viewing has the channel disabled to the other node and
              the arrows down mean the opposite. If both arrows are showing the
              channel doesnt work. Otherwise it just works one way which ideally
              you don't want in most cases, example being this case having a
              channel with Kraken on ur end only helps people depositing to
              Kraken from your other channels if you have any if it's mutual
              (which it should be with Kraken) then users withdrawing lightning
              sats to their wallet in Kraken have a chance to go through your
              node to get to where they need to go.

            >

            <p>
              Alright so now that's covered we can open the channel. First let's
              connect to Kraken or whoever your using. We need to take the
              address of the node amboss shows us and use it in this command.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>./lightning/cli/lightning-cli connect address</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Replace the address with the one from amboss it may have @ with an
              IP and then : with a port most likely 9735 which is fine to run in
              the command. After we connect to the node we want to open a
              channel with we can now run the command to open the channel. Once
              the channel is open it will auto connect everytime the node is
              restarted.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>./lightning/cli/lightning-cli fundchannel id amount</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              The id will be the output from the previous connect command and
              the amount is in sats so in our use case let's do the minimum
              1,000,000 wwritten without commas.
            </p>

            <p>
              The only other commands you really need to know are closing
              channels and withdrawing your funds. To close a channel run
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>./lightning/cli/lightning-cli close id</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              The id can be a channel id or the id of the node used to open the
              channel. If you want the channel id just run
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>./lightning/cli/lightning-cli listchannels</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              going back to the close command you can also add after the id a 0
              and then your personal bitcoin address to withdraw to. The 0 just
              tells core lightning to wait 0 seconds before executing the
              command. Otherwise it will default back to your lightning node
              wallet.
            </p>

            <p>
              The next command is withdrawing from the wallet. You must have the
              channels closed to get the bitcoin out of them as the channel
              holds the coins in its own "wallet". This command got my bitcoins
              stuck for 4 months as the default sat/vB was so low. I will show
              you how to prevent this as you can wound up stuck forever if it's
              set way to low for example but not low enough to be purged (due to
              others paying higher gas fees than you getting priority to be in
              the next block).
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>./lightning/cli/lightning-cli withdraw address amount fee</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              The amount is in sats and the address is your bitcoin address you
              want to send to the fee is optional but I would recommend it since
              I had some transactions get stuck. The fee to keep it simple is
              written as 4000perkb you will change the number. 4000perkb is = to
              4 sat/vB. You can check the current average block sat/vB by going
              to mempool I will leave a link for that below to. Then just
              multiply the current sat/vB by 1000 and use that number to be
              included in the next block or so.

              That's all you need to know to run a lightning node that is there
              to help the network. If you are interested in making money with
              your node you will need many 5,000,000 sat channels I would
              recommend at least 0.5 BTC sitting on your node in channels. For
              those people there is other commands we need to run to collect the
              fees earned from the node.

              If you don't plan to use RPC at all to connect a Bitcoin Node
              (running internally on your Lightning Node not 2 machines) you can
              setup OpenBSD pf module to block all connections that aren't
              through tor (you will need to disable this by adding # to each
              line when wanting to update the system and/or updating packages).
              This can be done by running
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">

            <p>
              Inside of pf.conf you can delete everything by entering 'dd' twice
              to delete the current line until the file is empty. After this
              make the file look like this

              You can of course just avoid typing the lines with a '#' in front.
              The # means these lines are "commented out" and will not be read.
              Then we just need to restart pf by running 'pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf'
              and that's it no more outside connections. Again only do this step
              if you don't plan on using RPC as it won't work doing this step.
              You should also change 'discover' to 0 in your bitcoin.conf for
              added security if you choose to go this route.

              That's it you can now just run the following command everytime you
              power on the machine.

              Or if your lazy like me/want to computer to auto reload the script
              on boot up from a power failure or update you can make the
              following rc script. Run <b>doas vim /etc/rc.d/lightningd</b>
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>
                #!/bin/ksh<br />
                <br />
                daemon="/home/username/lightning/lightningd/lightningd"<br />
                daemon_flags="--daemon --logfile=/home/username/lightning.log<br />
                <br />
                . /etc/rc.d/rc.subr<br />
                <br />
                rc_reload=YES<br />
                <br />
                rc_cmd $1

              Then all you have to do is make it executable with chmod then
              enable this to run at runtime. If you are still in TTY2 you can
              change to TTY1 and close lightningd with CTRL + C and then start
              it through rcctl or just leave it running and let rcctl handle
              starting it next bootup. If you want to start it through rcctl
              just use the same command and replace enable with start.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>doas chmod +x /etc/rc.d/lightnind</p>
              <br />
              <p>doas rcctl enable lightningd</p>

            <p>Enjoy your lightning node!</p>
