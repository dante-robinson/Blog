          <h2 class="post-title">4 Months of using various BSDs</h2>

          <p>
            Over the past 4 months I have been running various BSDs on my daily
            machine and I have to say I love it. I am coming from Gentoo Linux
            as a bit of background and I have been using Linux for about 5 years
            full time now, so I am writing with a decent amount of UNIX-Like
            experience. This will be mostly a discussion comparing BSD to Linux
            and what I like about and dislike about the various BSDs by itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            For those looking for a TLDR (To Long Didn't Read) I will be
            sticking with OpenBSD for the time being and if something doesn't
            work out I will be looking to move back to FreeBSD or Gentoo. I
            think BSD is amazing and the changes over Linux are worth making the
            switch.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are currently running on macOS or Windows you may be thinking
            you might need to run Linux before trying out BSD this is not the
            case at all. It more or less depends on how much work your willing
            to put into switching, BSD install process is not complex but it is
            more hands on and to someone who may be less tech literate than
            others using a TUI (Terminal User Interface) or CLI (Command Line
            Interface) based installers may seem scary, they are not, do not be
            afraid of these things. I would recommend trying FreeBSD as opposed
            to something like Ubuntu as FreeBSD can do like 99% of what Linux
            can do and is a lighter OS with less garbage like systemd or snap
            packages. FreeBSD has a great writeup on how to install from scratch
            with PICTURES! as well as a command line guide for basic commands
            and how to install a Desktop interface (as you have many options
            unlike macOS/Windows). You can find the Handbook here -

            <p>
              This is a great question the short answer is that it probably
              doesn't. If your someone who just uses a computer and doesn't care
              about how it works then it probably isn't going to matter. If your
              actively looking to improve your development environment even
              macOS is a good option over windows as it comes with an actual
              shell unlike Windows command line. If your starting to say to
              yourself I want to run something open source that not only myself
              but others can audit the code and make sure it's safe. Then your
              starting to look into Linux and BSD. What is most important is
              does your current OS do what you want it to do? If not then you
              probably don't need to change it. If your looking to move to all
              open source software maybe try using the applications on your OS
              first. Apps like GoDot, Krita, KdenLive, LibreOffice are available
              for many different OSes. If these tools aren't going to work for
              you chances are BSD or Linux won't either.
            </p>

            <h3 class="header">Why BSD over Linux?<a id="linux"></a></h3>

            <p>
              Linux has all these modern hip applications and all these
              different package management systems and so many distros to choose
              from why even consider BSD? Well the issue with "distros" on Linux
              is they aren't really doing anything (no offense devs...). Most
              distros are merely a fork of someone else design for example
              Debian and Ubuntu both use the same package manager both work very
              similar, so where is the difference? The packages that come
              preinstalled on the distro that can range from a different Desktop
              Environment (DE) to pre-installed packages/configs on the machine
              ready to use right after install.
            </p>

            <p>
              Not all Linux distros are made this way but a majority of them
              are. So why should you install one over the other? Well the whole
              point in the creators minds is that it makes everything work the
              way you want it out of the box. For 80-90% that's probably not the
              case though which make basically every distro a waste of not only
              the creators time but also adds to the complexity of the space.
            </p>

            <p>
              So what's the difference with the Linux distros that aren't forks?
              These distros actually develop something rather than manage a
              package repo. These distros have new package managers new init
              systems and in some cases like Gentoo completely different ways of
              doing things from the majority. Here is a full list of all the
              Linux distros you will notice a majority fork off from another
              project but even still there are a decent maybe 10% ish are
              standalone distros without forks.
            </p>

            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions"

            >
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions</a
            >

            <p>
              However even with the new package managers most of these distros
              are still the same thing. They have designed a new package
              management system which might be easier to use or they have some
              new feature like the AUR. However only maybe 1% of distros are
              actually doing something unique. Gentoo, Bedrock, KISS, Nix,
              Chimera and maybe even Void. These guys are using the Linux Kernel
              like the other distros but actually are different. Maybe that
              means they are straying from the GNU Code base, using a new C
              library and the list goes on. If your not looking at these distros
              the experience you will have on Linux is going to be mostly the
              same, even something like Fedora (RedHat Based) to Mint (Debian
              Based) is going to feel like the same thing. Not all forks are
              useless some like PopOS for example are making their own Desktop's
              which is cool.
            </p>

            <p>
              Linux is very confusing it's the first question everyone asks
              "what distro do I install?" There's even guides (bad) on this
              topic in a quick search. BSD doesn't have this issue you have many
              variations of BSD which you can find at the link below.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now that may seem like a lot and it is but there are really only 4
              main BSDs that comes up in conversation maybe 5. You may not even
              have heard of any besides the largest one FreeBSD. So what's the
              difference here? FreeBSD is designed to run everything like Linux
              does and can even emulate Linux actually. This is more your
              mainstream BSD this where over 70% answered to a survey in 2005
              saying they use FreeBSD. This is probably where most users want to
              be as eveything is most likely to work like they want. OpenBSD is
              more based around security of course but not just that it's more
              code correctness, I personally really like the goals of this
              project however you will encounter many issues that you will
              probably need to fix yourself and some software doesn't even work
              that may work on other BSDs for example. NetBSD focus is around
              bringing BSD to every possible platform, this is probably not what
              you think it is it doesn't mean the latest GPUs and stuff but more
              in the sense of architectures. For example POWERPC or ARM and
              those 2 are just minor in comparison to the list of platforms they
              support feel free to check out their site it's incredible
              honestly. If you had a PowerMac you will know a lot of Linux
              distros dropped support for it you might be worried FreeBSD will
              drop support for example next this makes NetBSD a very compelling
              option. The downside of this is the dev team is focused on so many
              platforms without enough devs it's tough to add modern support for
              things or even bug fixes. DragonFly BSD main focus is speed the
              hardware is really lacking it may not work for you at the time of
              writing at least however it's really cool to just reading their
              home page will tell you so much about what's different, worth the
              read.
            </p>

            <p>
              The next major difference as you have probably realized by now is
              unlike Linux distros which are mostly all the same core packages,
              BSD is it's own complete system each BSD is different from each
              other. BSDs do use each others code from time to time to add a
              feature but personally I think this needs to be done more often to
              get modern hardware supported quickly. What do you gain from a
              complete system? Well besides the huge differences in each BSD
              this allows the project to offer a more stable system than Linux
              (no really!), not only that it allows for the system to be more
              optimized at the base level working with everything nicely because
              well.. it was designed to around using each piece of that base. So
              why is it more stable? It's a pretty bold claim this may not be
              true for the bleeding edge of hardware however when your able to
              make sure everything works with each other nothing should ever
              break but besides that the system updates as a whole. Have you
              ever noticed Linux distros like Ubuntu have a release? This is
              because they update the GNU core utils among other system packages
              all at once. Linux is mainly designed around GNU software but try
              running musl notice the breakages even Clang/LLVM a few years back
              wouldn't compile everything I still don't think it does today.
              Some portable kernel huh... There is so much room for error from
              different parties trying make everything work together maybe Linux
              updates and GNU needs to patch something for it that comes a day
              later this kernel update could make something unstable it happens.
              When the OS is a complete system like BSD it doesn't happen unless
              your running -current.
            </p>

            <p>
              Packages on Linux come from your main distro repo but not just
              that. You then need to trust other random people on the internet
              when using things like the AUR or even adding a new repo to your
              package manager because you can't find that package you need/want.
              This can be a huge security risk and BSD you don't need to do any
              of that. People praise the AUR but it's not that special when you
              think about it and I've used Arch for over a year. Meet BSDs Port
              system not only can you download binaries from a trusted source
              for your packages but you can also get direct access to the source
              code of those packages to compile them natively in your local
              ports tree. I will admit it's not as nice as Gentoo's portage as
              in the package manger doesn't directly support building the
              packages and they will need to be done manually like 99% of other
              Linux distros. FreeBSD does have a tool called Poudriere which can
              compile lots of ports for you in 1 command with the options you
              want. So who can manage ports? People approved by that BSD. Is it
              as good as the AUR? It terms of security it destroys it. In terms
              of total available packages FreeBSD is your best best at around
              half the packages as the AUR. Your more than welcome to join the
              ports team to manage packages you want to bring to the BSD this
              basically makes it the same as the capabilites of the AUR. The
              only real difference being the packages aren't supported yet
              because people aren't maintaining them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Changes are actually discussed. Have you noticed something with
              Linux over the years that some things just don't make any sense?

              So it's all good to add 500K lines of code for new GPUs but
              keeping 65K lines of code for older CPU support is bloat? That
              makes no sense. If anything we should be refining the driver code
              that's huge has to be a way to improve that. Well it's not that
              easy you might think or it's that size for a reason. Right check
              this

            <p>
              Same ls command on OpenBSD is 600 ish lines of code where as in
              the GNU core utils it's 5600 ish. That's an insane difference!
              It's like the code was just slapped together it works good enough
              never touch it again. i386 support was already dropped in Linux as
              well as i486 recently I think... now Itanium? These are not
              massive savings and if you think it's bloat the support isn't even
              compiled in the kernel on your OS as it's for a different
              architecture. I do want to say I get where the development team is
              coming from it does talk developer resources to maintain, it's the
              same issue I mentioned with NetBSD above. I do think though it
              should be added a secondary type of system no system should every
              not be supported on Linux with the amount of developers they have.
              I come from a biased opinion on this as I enjoy using old hardware
              and seeing what modern tasks it can handle.
            </p>

            <p>
              This brings me into my next point proper clean code. Things get
              looked at multiple times on BSD. How can this be lighter/cleaner?
              On Linux it feels like slap something together pray it works an
              never touch it until it breaks, It's just horrible development
              design. This isn't just an issue with Linux but GNU as well which
              is what most distros are using.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2020 the Linux kernel had 27.8 million lines of code. That is
              huge! This is just the kernel not including all the utils or Xorg,
              etc. For comparison another bloated project is web browsers with
              Chrome coming in at a whopping 35 million lines. A project like
              OpenBSD has 33.8 million lines of code at the time of writing and
              that includes an Xorg server as well as like 5 pre installed
              Window Managers (WM). Not to mention it's entire complete system
              all the utils, compilers, etc. Code size is not the be all end all
              either though Linux supports more devices which one could argue
              explains it's code size however it does seem rather large in
              comparison.

              The topic people either care a lot about or not at all. I'm going
              to cover this briefly the BSD license allows anyone to take the
              code and does not require the project to be open sourced to use it
              unlike the GPL. It is a very short and concise license unlike the
              GPL. I don't have any issues with GPL licensed code personally
              however I disagree with the philosophy behind it. I understand the
              argument that BSD licensed code can and has been used in macOS as
              well as windows and probably even more closed source software but
              I think this is actually a good thing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hear me out if you create a standard for something isn't it better
              for everyone else to use that same standard library or package for
              ease of use across different platforms? Take for example zsh
              imagine if you couldn't use this natively on macOS like bash
              because of a license. Just sounds stupid... OpenSSH is BSD
              licensed and is able to be used by default on closed source OSes
              imagine if it wasn't... Microsoft and Apple may have may their own
              standard applications for both, sounds like a serious pain. GCC
              isn't used on macOS either Clang/LLVM is over again licensing
              issues so now your losing out on a huge company auditing your code
              because they use it, that's some huge support your losing over a
              license.
            </p>

            <p>
              That's all I want to say on licenses there's really not much else
              to say. If you believe everything should be open sourced like GNU
              then the GPL is for you. It's a great idea but unrealistic.

            <h3 class="header">Documentation<a id="docs"></a></h3>

            <p>
              Documentation can be really good or really bad depending on how
              you look at it. On all the BSDs you are basically required to read
              man the man pages which is as simple as running the "man" and then
              the command you wish to run however you can also use the -k flag
              to help find the command you may need. However this is not the be
              all end all in my opinion sometimes having a full guide on how to
              setup poudriere or some other more complex task. FreeBSD does
              handle this quite well in my opinion the best out of all the BSDs,
              the handbook they provide for installation and post installation
              is amazing and they have many guides for setting things up like
              bhyve as well as poudriere which is a pro. Other systems like
              OpenBSD do have a FAQ section which is useful for many things that
              need a guide however once you pass these 2 BSDs it's not great.
              NetBSD there is no documentation to even setup SLiM and yes I
              tried slim_enable="yes" or whatever in my config file, it's not in
              the manpage either basic stuff like this should be documented.
              NetBSD has a documentation section for quite a few things which
              could be good but some other important things are still missing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall documentation is great the manpages are great haven't had
              any real major issues it's more just a different mind set, instead
              of say doing a search when you have an issue you read the manpages
              for that application instead to understand what you want it to do.

            <h3 class="header">Foundations<a id="foundations"></a></h3>

            <p>
              Now this is an interesting topic, for starters many people bash
              The FreeBSD Foundation because some of the core members of the
              foundation use macbooks as their daily drivers. I think the
              foundation is not so much the devs some might be but I would say
              the foundation is more in charge of marketing and financial type
              of stuff so it's not a big deal.
            </p>

            <p>
              The other big issue I want to talk about is NDAs and how well
              OpenBSD guys handle NDAs, they have a policy to not sign any NDAs.
              Other BSDs like FreeBSD Foundation does sign NDAs but some of the
              core devs don't so it's really up in the air to what changes some
              of these BSDs can make. The issue with NDAs is they are not
              legally allowed to talk or make changes for the things they are
              signing about. The problem is the divide between the devs if the
              foundation signs an NDA and they say in their own words "The
              Foundation also represents the FreeBSD Project in executing
              contracts, license agreements, and other legal arrangements that
              require a recognized legal entity." You then have other devs who
              didn't sign NDAs working on the same project saying they can make
              these changes. Here is a clip
            </p>

            <p>
              Linux Foundation also supports signing NDAs as well. I personally
              like the way OpenBSD handles these things by signing no NDAs, yes
              this will lead to less support from these companies.

            <h3 class="header">Gaming<a id="gaming"></a></h3>

            <p>
              If you play open sourced games like 0AD or SuperTuxKart then all
              the BSDs should work for you. Games like Veloren are currently not
              on OpenBSD but work on FreeBSD. If your a gamer you should most
              likely stick with Windows or Linux, however if you want to use BSD
              for gaming and don't mind tweaking things to work your best bet is
              using FreeBSD. FreeBSD currently runs steam and thus proton
              through its Linux compatibility layer as sadly Steam doesn't
              support BSDs despite claiming to support open source platforms. I
              have listed a Youtube channel below the records various games on
              BSD as well as another tool that does the setup for you for
              certain games to work out of the box on FreeBSD so you can see if
              it supports the games you are looking to play.

            <h3 class="header">Recommendations<a id="recommend"></a></h3>

            <p>
              I personally would recommend running any servers you can on
              OpenBSD just for the added security benefits as well as the
              smaller code base. Instead of following my security guide for
              Linux I think just using OpenBSD is a better option.
            </p>

            <p>
              In terms of a desktop OpenBSD is actually very capable despite
              being focused heavily around security. No it's not going to be as
              smooth or elegant as a workstation designed OS like macOS and you
              will need to make some tweaks to config files for unveil so your
              browser can read files on your computer (to upload things).
              OpenBSD has support for almost everything you may need it's not
              perfect but most users should be able to live with it. Krita,
              Kdenlive, Libreoffice, GoDot all exist in the ports tree for
              OpenBSD and work fine, meaning you can Photo & Video edit, make
              games, and even do office work without issues. For programming you
              have neovim and geany, not all neovim plugins work so you will
              most likely need to make your own configuration file. Things like
              React or NextJS don't work without tweaking it and even if you do
              tweak the code to run people have reported auto refresh functions
              not working. OpenBSD you will more or less have to see if it will
              work for you.
            </p>

            <p>
              If OpenBSD doesn't work for you then I would recommend trying
              FreeBSD before going to Linux, FreeBSD has the same ports as
              mentioned above but includes React and NextJS support working out
              of the box as well as a port for VSCode. Auto refresh still
              doesn't work without messing around with fswatch-mon or by using
              webpack to work with react's auto refresh. FreeBSD offers many
              more ports and will be much easier to use than OpenBSD in terms of
              not needing to try to get so many things working manually. If you
              do play games I still recommend going with Windows or Linux but if
              you can live with FreeBSDs gaming support then it's your best
              choice.
            </p>

            <p>
              DragonFly BSD wouldn't work on any of my computers so I can't
              really recommend it, it looks cool but I can't say much more
              beyond that. As for NetBSD if you have an older computer what else
              are you really going to run? You can run that outdated macOS
              version on your powermac or you can run NetBSD with the latest
              security patches, really depends what you want to do with that
              machine. I think NetBSD has a place but in my opinion it's not for
              modern hardware just due to how many different supported
              architectures there are, I don't see fixes for modern hardware
              coming in a timely manner. I could be wrong here I didn't daily
              drive it for long enough but with OpenBSD and FreeBSD being
              available I only see NetBSD as being useful on my older machines.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the end of the day the support for applications and games comes
              down to us the people. If you want gaming on BSD you need to run
              BSD and ask for game support from Steam otherwise if your still
              playing on Linux why would they care? They didn't lose you as a
              customer they don't care what platform your on. This is for alot
              of different things if we want proper React or NextJS (Working
              now) support we need to ask for it or help program it ourselves
              and upload the Pull Request. If you want to try BSD but can't
              because something doesn't work, it's most likely not going to work
              unless someone (you) does something about it.
